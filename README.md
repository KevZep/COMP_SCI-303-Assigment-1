# COMP_SCI-303-Assigment-1

//This is assigment 1 for Data Structure
//Some things to note:
//Most if not all code should have a comments explaining what the code does.
//The code uses vectors, not arrays, but same functionality should keep the main goal of this assigment.
//Should contain 2 cpp files and one h file, have these files in the program before running it
//It would ask the file name (such as data.txt), you have to have the file you wanna use in the same location as the code is located.
//At the begining, the program will ask for the size of the; first the lenght for each line, then how many rows/lines
//For example:
// 2 5 6 8
// 4 2 25 6
// 9 3 500 6209
//If yout txt file has this, you should put the number in this order: 4, then 3. Four number per line, and 3 lines in total. Failing to do so will give you either an error or a odd looking table.
//You can test with the included txt file, just put this in order when the program ask: data.txt 10 3
